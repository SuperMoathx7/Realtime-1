## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project follows a **multi-process architecture** where:

- **Parent Process (Referee)**: Manages game state, visualization, and coordination
- **Child Processes (Players)**: Independent player entities with autonomous behavior
- **Real-Time Communication**: Continuous data exchange between processes
- **Event-Driven Design**: Signal-based phase transitions and game events

### Data Structures

#### Player Information Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    int team;                    // Team number (1 or 2)
    int member;                  // Member number within team
    int energy, decay, returnAfter; // Player attributes
    int effort;                  // Calculated effort value
    float x, y;                  // Current display position
    float targetX, targetY;      // Target positions for movement
    float radius;                // Visual representation radius
    pid_t pid;                   // Process identifier
} PlayerInfo;
```

#### Communication Message Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    pid_t pid;                   // Sender process ID
    int team;                    // Team identifier
    int member;                  // Member identifier
    int effort;                  // Calculated effort (energy/decay_rate)
    int energy, decay, returnAfter; // Current player state
    int type;                    // Message type (0=periodic, 1=alignment, 2=pulling)
} EffortMsg;
```

## üì° Communication Techniques

### 1. **Unix Pipes**
- **Anonymous Pipes**: Primary communication channel between parent and child processes
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Prevents deadlocks and ensures real-time responsiveness
- **Message-based Protocol**: Structured data exchange using `EffortMsg` format

```c
// Pipe creation and configuration
if (pipe(pipefd) == -1) {
    perror("pipe creation failed");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
pipe_read_fd = pipefd[0]; // Parent reads from this end

// Non-blocking mode setup
int flags = fcntl(pipe_read_fd, F_GETFL, 0);
fcntl(pipe_read_fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
```

### 2. **Unix Signals**
- **SIGUSR1**: Triggers player alignment phase
- **SIGUSR2**: Initiates pulling phase
- **SIGPWR**: Signals new round beginning
- **Custom Signal Handlers**: Phase-specific behavior implementation

```c
// Signal handler registration
sigset(SIGUSR1, alignment_handler);     // Alignment phase
sigset(SIGUSR2, pulling_handler);       // Pulling phase
sigset(SIGPWR, newrnd);                // New round
```

### 3. **Shared State Management**
- **Process-local State**: Each player maintains independent state
- **Centralized Coordination**: Referee process coordinates global game state
- **Event-driven Updates**: State changes trigger appropriate responses

### 4. **Real-time Synchronization**
- **Timer-based Coordination**: Precise timing for game phases
- **Asynchronous Message Processing**: Non-blocking communication patterns
- **Phase Synchronization**: Ensures all players transition phases together

```

## üéÆ Usage

### Running the Game
```bash
make run
```

### Game Controls

- Score updates and round progression
- Win conditions and final results

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The game behavior is customizable through the `inputs.txt` configuration file:

```
energy_min=75          # Minimum initial player energy
energy_max=100         # Maximum initial player energy
decay_min=3            # Minimum energy decay rate
decay_max=5            # Maximum energy decay rate
recovery_min=1         # Minimum recovery time
recovery_max=3         # Maximum recovery time
threshold=900          # Effort threshold for calculations
game_duration=80       # Maximum game duration (seconds)
score_limit=2          # Consecutive wins needed for victory
total_rounds=5         # Total number of rounds
```

### Parameter Validation
- Energy values must be positive integers
- Minimum values must be less than maximum values
- All parameters undergo validation during startup

## üèÜ Game Rules

### Team Composition
- **2 Teams**: Each with 4 players
- **Strategic Positioning**: Players closer to rope have higher multipliers
- **Energy-based Performance**: Player effectiveness depends on current energy

### Winning Conditions
1. **Midpoint Rule**: If any player crosses the center line, their team loses the round
2. **Consecutive Wins**: First team to win 2 consecutive rounds wins the game
3. **Round Limit**: Game ends after specified number of rounds
4. **Time Limit**: Game ends when duration expires
5. **Exhaustion**: If all players reach zero energy, the round is declared a tie

### Effort Calculation
- **Individual Effort**: `energy / decay_rate`
- **Position Multipliers**: 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x (closest to farthest from rope)
- **Team Effort**: Sum of all multiplied individual efforts
- **Movement**: Based on effort differential between teams

### Player Mechanics
- **Energy Decay**: Gradual energy loss during pulling phase
- **Recovery**: Players regenerate energy after falling
- **Falling**: 5% probability per iteration during intense pulling
- **Positioning**: Strategic alignment based on current energy levels

- **Process Count**: 9 processes (1 referee + 8 players)
- **Update Frequency**: 1Hz for player updates, 60Hz for visualization
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal shared state, process-local data

### System Requirements
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended
